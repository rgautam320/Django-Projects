# Complete ToDo App by Rajan Gautam using Django as Backend and React as Frontend

This project was made by Rajan Gautam using Django, React and Bootstrap.

## Steps to Run the Application

Pull the repository into your device and run it as you used to run Django Application.

-   (You may need to install 'requirements.txt' if you don't have these already)

-   (You also need to build React Application as it has been ignored in git and also need node_modules.)

OR You can simply go through the below link.
